"""In-memory pub/sub for run events.

Each run gets zero-or-more subscribers; the orchestrator publishes events
as the pipeline progresses; subscribers (the SSE route) receive them via
async queues. When the run terminates the publisher pushes a sentinel
``None`` to each queue so subscribers can close cleanly.
